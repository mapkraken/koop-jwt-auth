# Secure Your Geospatial APIs with JWT Authentication in Koop

**Reading time: 2 minutes**

In today's interconnected world, geospatial data powers everything from navigation apps to urban planning tools. But with great data comes great responsibility â€“ specifically, the responsibility to secure it. That's where JWT (JSON Web Token) authentication comes in, and why we've created this example implementation for Koop applications.

## What is This Project?

The Koop JWT Authentication Example is a production-ready implementation that shows developers how to add robust token-based authentication to their Koop geospatial servers. [Koop](https://koopjs.github.io/) is an open-source geospatial data server that transforms data from various sources into standard formats that mapping applications can consume.

This example provides:
- Multiple authentication endpoints for different use cases
- Salesforce JWT integration for enterprise environments
- Token verification and validation
- A comprehensive test suite with 23 passing tests
- Clear documentation and examples

## Why JWT Authentication Matters

Traditional session-based authentication requires servers to store session data, creating scalability challenges for distributed geospatial services. JWT tokens solve this by being:

1. **Stateless**: All necessary information is contained within the token
2. **Scalable**: No server-side session storage required
3. **Secure**: Cryptographically signed to prevent tampering
4. **Flexible**: Can carry custom claims like permissions and organization IDs

For geospatial applications, this means you can secure your map services, feature layers, and spatial queries without sacrificing performance or scalability.

## Real-World Applications

This authentication system is particularly valuable for:

- **Enterprise GIS**: Organizations using Salesforce can seamlessly integrate their existing authentication
- **Multi-tenant Applications**: The token structure supports organization IDs and user permissions
- **Microservices**: Stateless tokens work perfectly in distributed architectures
- **Mobile Apps**: Tokens can be easily stored and transmitted by mobile clients

## Getting Started is Simple

```bash
# Clone and setup
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/koop-jwt-auth.git
cd koop-jwt-auth/koop-jwt
npm install

# Start the server
npm start

# Run the tests
npm test
```

The example includes five authentication endpoints, from basic token generation to Salesforce-specific JWT handling, making it easy to adapt to your specific needs.

## The Bottom Line

Security shouldn't be an afterthought in geospatial applications. With this JWT authentication example, you can implement enterprise-grade security in your Koop server in minutes, not months. Whether you're serving weather data to millions or providing sensitive infrastructure maps to field teams, proper authentication is your first line of defense.
