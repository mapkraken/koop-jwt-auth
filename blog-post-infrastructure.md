# One Server to Rule Them All: Using Koop as Your Universal Authentication Provider

**Reading time: 2 minutes**

Every additional service in your infrastructure is another point of failure, another server to maintain, and another line item in your cloud bill. What if your geospatial server could also handle authentication for your entire application ecosystem? With Koop's JWT authentication capabilities, you can use it as a universal auth provider for your React apps, mobile clients, and any other services that need authentication with third party applicaitons such as Salesforce.

## The Hidden Costs of Separate Auth Services

Traditional architectures often look like this:
- Authentication Service (Auth0, Okta, or custom)
- API Gateway
- Geospatial Server (Koop)
- React Application Server
- Database
- Session Management Service

That's at least six services to configure, monitor, and scale. Each connection between services adds latency, complexity, and potential security vulnerabilities. For many organizations, especially those integrating with third party applications like Salesforce, this complexity is unnecessary.

## Koop as Your Universal Auth Provider

Here's the game-changer: Koop can serve as the authentication provider for your entire stack:

```
Before: 
- React App → Auth Service → Session Store
- React App → API Gateway → Koop
- Mobile App → Auth Service → Session Store

After:
- React App → Koop (auth + geo + sessions)
- Mobile App → Koop (auth + geo + sessions)
- Any Service → Koop (auth + geo + sessions)
```

Your React application authenticates with third party applications through Koop, receives a JWT token, and uses that same token for all subsequent requests - whether they're for geospatial data or any other authenticated operations.

## Real Benefits, Real Savings

**Unified Authentication**: One login flow for everything. Your React app authenticates users through Koop's JWT integration, then uses the same JWT for all API calls.

**Session Management Built-In**: No need for Redis or separate session stores. JWT tokens handle state, and Koop manages the authentication lifecycle.

**Cost Reduction**: Eliminate Auth0/Okta fees ($25-100 per user/year) and separate session management infrastructure. One Koop server replaces multiple services.

**Simplified Frontend**: Your React app only needs to know one endpoint for auth, whether users are accessing maps, data, or other features.

## Perfect for Salesforce-Integrated Apps

This approach especially shines when:
- Your React app needs Salesforce authentication
- Users need access to both geospatial and non-geospatial data
- You want single sign-on across multiple applications
- Mobile and web apps share the same backend

## Implementation in Your React App

```javascript
// In your React app
const authenticateWithKoop = async (salesforceToken) => {
  const response = await fetch('https://your-koop-server.com/auth/salesforce', {
    method: 'POST',
    body: JSON.stringify({ token: salesforceToken })
  });
  
  const { sessionToken } = await response.json();
  
  // Use this token for ALL subsequent requests
  localStorage.setItem('authToken', sessionToken);
  
  // Now use the same token for Koop geospatial calls
  const mapData = await fetch('https://your-koop-server.com/your-provider/FeatureServer/0/query', {
    headers: { 'Authorization': `Bearer ${sessionToken}` }
  });
};
```

## Beyond Just Geospatial

The beauty of this approach is that Koop becomes your universal backend:
- **Authentication Provider**: Handle Salesforce JWT exchange
- **Session Manager**: Issue and validate session tokens
- **Geospatial Server**: Serve your maps and features
- **API Gateway**: Route and authorize all requests

Your React application gets a single, consistent authentication flow that works across all features.

## The Smart Path Forward

Why maintain separate auth services when Koop can handle it all? By using Koop as your authentication provider, your React applications get:
- Seamless Salesforce integration
- Unified authentication across all services
- One token for everything
- Dramatically simplified infrastructure

Start simple. Let Koop be the backbone of your authenticated applications.
